Course Project Repository for Getting and Cleaning Data


------code logic--------


This is a course project for Getting and Cleaning Data on Cousera

as required in the project, for step 1, I downloaded the training and test data set and combine X_train and X_test 
I also combined Y_train and Y_test and use the combine result as the activity type number for each X record

for step 2, ï¼©first applied feature.txt as column name of measurement of the dataset, then I selected measurements that only contain "mean()" or "std()"

for step 3, the activity decription is applied by combining dataset with activity_labels.txt dataset

step 4, descriptive variable names are applied manually to each columns, measurement names are applied in step 2





-----How the code works---------

To make the code work, you need to place the unzipped source data folder(do not rename the folder otherwise the code will fail to work)
placed in the same directory of code file. 

I did not download the file in the code as it might be slow and that is the case for me.
